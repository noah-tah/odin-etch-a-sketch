# Etch-a-Sketch The Odin Project

Lets go!!


I will be writing the etch-a-sketch project.

# How do I think about an etch-a-sketch
    - A large container which constitutes the etch a sketch device
    - A variable amount of cells inside of the container (user defined)
        - We should know that each of these cells will be either divs or buttons
        - We will use flexbox to make sure the buttons/divs will shrink/grow to fit the parent container
        - The cells will have :hover animations, and on click they will change color accordingly
            - I like the idea of a random color on click
    - I like the idea of having a clear sketch button
    - I also like the idea of having an eraser functionality
    - Instead of implementing a color pallet I want the following:
        - An option for a single solid color i choose (black,red,blue,pink... etc)
        - An option for a random color to be chosen each time a cell is selected
